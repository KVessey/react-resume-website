# react-resume-website
This application is intented to be my personal portfolio / website application to showcase some of my Software Engineering skills. It features a social media style blog where users can register an account, add their professional experiences and education, as well as post in a blog to connect with others who access this site.

This app was built using the MERN stack, which I had used the following technologies to build and deploy:
* `MongoDB Atlas`
* `Express.js`
* `React.js`
* `Node.js`


## Download and Installation

To begin using the React Resume Website project, use the following steps to get started:
* [Fork, Clone, or Download on GitHub](https://github.com/KVessey/react-resume-website) React Resume Website

## Setup
### Node Packages
1. First we need to make sure Node.js is installed and up to date. On windows, open the command prompt and enter:
 `node -v`

User should see a node version

Also be sure to check if you have the Node Package Manager (npm) installed.
`npm -v`
npm should come with the Node.js download. If not, be sure to download that as well

2. After pulling the code to a local directory, install all of the node dependencies which are listed in the package.json file by running the following command in the target directory:
 `npm install`

This will import all of the dependencies needed for this project, which are listed in the package.json file:
